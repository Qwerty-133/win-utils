# RClone Backups

This tool performs continual backups of files present in a root folder, with special handling for folders to be backed up infrequently.

The `rclone` executable should be accessible through the name "rclone" (Add it to PATH if necessary.)

> :warning: This script currently doesn't work and isn't adequately tested. There needs to be additional handling for file version control and deleted file history.

## Usage

Run the [`__main__.py`](__main__.py) Python script.
